; Threads are exciting
;
; A thread is represented by its state, which is simply its
; stack and its registers.
; But its registers can just be stored on its stack when we
; get an interrupt. So really we just need to store the stacks.
;
; Each thread gets its own stack, 1 page long.
; We'll keep a list of threads in our stack.
